# Today I began by looking at the 'as' keyword. I really
# don't yet understand this at all. My investigation of
# it made me realize, however, that I need to do some
# review of previous concepts, specifically importing
# files into my script and all the commands, modes, etc
# associated with that. I am currently particularly hung
# up on the "truncate" command and on how to make the
# 'r' (read) and 'w' (write) modes work in concert.
# when I try to do both in the same script I get error
# messages and strange outputs in my terminal. For
# example: after performing a '.read' command on the
# file object created from importing a txt file, and then
# truncating the file, I wrote new text into the txt
# file and instructed the script to read and print
# that text. The output in my terminal came out as
# an integer expressing the number of characters and
# spaces in the text (ex: the text '1, 2, 3' prints
# the output '7' to the terminal).
