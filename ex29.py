# STUDY DRILLS

#1
# Q: What do you thing the 'if' does to the code
# under it?
# A: It causes it to run if the conditions following
# the 'if' are met and to not run if those conditions
# are not met.

#2
# Q: Why does the code under the 'if' need to be
# indented 4 spaces?
# A: This designates that these lines of code fall
# within the if statement and are only run if it is
# called by its conditions being met. It is the same
# formating that is uesd for writing a function.

#3
# Q: What happens if it isn't indented?
# A: The terminal returns an error message stating that
# an indent was expected.
