continue
# ?

def
# creats a function.

del
# ?

elif
# creates a branch in a function when there are three
# or more branches.

else
# creats the final potential branch in a function
# containing a branching program of any number of
# possibilites that is >= 2.

except
# ?

exec
# ?

finally
# ?

for
# creates a 'for' loop which passes a value or set of
# values into the function contained within and then
# returns a resulting value or set of values made
# by having the function act upon the passed through
# values. A 'for' loop can also be made to pass its
# returned value or values into a list var.

from
# ?

global
# ?

if
# creates a branching program and provides for the
# first potential branch in that program.

import
# imports a module into this one to use.

in
# part of a for loop which connects the list to be
# passed into the function's arg ('the_count') and
# establishes the arg into which the value(s) of
# that list is(are) to be passed into ('number')

# ex:
# the_count = [1, 2, 3]
#
# for number in the_count:
#   print(f"This is the count {number}")
#
# Will return:
# This is the count 1
# This is the count 2
# This is the count 3

not
# logical not. In bullion logic = adds a 'False +'

pass
# ?

print

raise

return
# ?
# we've studied this but I've become sorely aware of
