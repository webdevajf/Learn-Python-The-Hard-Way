You are in a castle that is under siege from a zombie hoard.
The castle walls and gate are holding the hoard off with no
difficulty but the castle is running out of food and you and your
people will soon starve if you stay here. At the back of the castle
is a drawbridge that can be used to cross a deep chasam which runs
behind the castle. This chasam cannot be crossed by the zombie
hoard and so it is by way of this drawbridge that you and your
people can make your escape. There is just one problem: the
drawbridge has not been used in decades. It is in disrepair and
cannot be lowerd. It must be fixed before you can escape.
