## So the essence of this game will be that your
## character is in a castle that is under siege from
## a zombie hoard. The castle walls and gate are
## holding the hoard off with no difficulty but the
## castle is running out of food. At the back of the
## castle is a drawbridge that can be used to cross a
## deep chasam that runs behind the castle. This
## chasam cannot be crossed by the zombie hoard and
## so it is by way of this drawbridge that you and
## your people will make your escape. There is just
## one problem: the drawbridge has not been used in
## decades. It is in disrepair and cannot be lowerd.
## The wooden gears have rotted and the chain has
## rusted. You need to construct a new chain and
## new gears before you can make your escape.
