## So the essence of this game will be that your
## character is in a castle that is under siege from
## a zombie hoard. The castle walls and gate are
## holding the hoard off with no difficulty but the
## castle is running out of food. At the back of the
## castle is a drawbridge that can be used to cross a
## deep chasam that runs behind the castle. This
## chasam cannot be crossed by the zombie hoard and
## so it is by way of this drawbridge that you and
## your people will make your escape. There is just
## one problem: the drawbridge has not been used in
## decades. It is in disrepair and cannot be lowerd.
## The wooden gears have rotted and the chain has
## rusted. You need to construct a new chain and
## new gears before you can make your escape.

## Note: So I didn't do the best job of sticking to the format that Z. Shaw
## recommends for work flow on the first half of this project. Having gone
## through about half of the thing now I really see the importance of that now.
## The second half of the projcect really involves a separate system that
## opperates within the game (The carpenter creating gears), independent of the
## first one (the blacsmith creating a chain). The workflow is important because
## on bigger projects it would be impossible to keep track of all the moving
## parts that the programmer has to manage and develope to say nothing of keeping
## a team on the same page. I'm going to try to do a better job of this for
## this half of the project.

## THE Z. SHAW CODING PROCESS:
#1 Write a to do list.
#2 Pick the easiest thing from your list.
#3 Describe the thing in your source code in English comments.
#4 Write code under the comments.
#5 run the code to see if it works.
#5 stay in the cycle of writing code, running it to test it, and fixing it untill
## it works.
#6 cross the task off your list, go to the next task, repeat.


## current task:
## see ex36test2.py lines 99 through 105

## TO DO LIST:

#A) X
## find a way to use a for-loop in this game.

## See Trello




## PROBLEMS TO SOLVE:

#1 figure out how to 'dedent' as opposed to 'indent' lines

#2 remember that printing a var with a formated string for it's value will create
## a different formating (vis-a-vis line spacing) than simply printing a string.
## see ex36test4.py for examples.


## QUESTIONS THAT NEED ANSWERING:
