# I am creating this file for a very specific purpose.
# There are days where I spend the day studying
# something programing related but because I'm stuck
# or need to delve deeper into a subject before I can
# actually write code related to it. On some of these
# days I don't actually write any code though I am
# spending time studying programming. These,
# "credit_where_due" files will be a place for me to
# detail what I was studying on that day and therefore
# a way to show GitHub that I  have been doing something
# that day and not simply neglecting to code.
